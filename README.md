# ECD Interview Test

## Running
The solution can be run from the terminal with the command:
`php src/parser.php --file <path to input file> --unique-combinations <output file name>`

The program will infer the file type from the file extension and default to csv if there
is no extension present.

Only csv and tsv are supported.
